
The Knight Bus Booking is a part of Database Programming System Laboratory (CSS326), Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology by the Golden Trio. We aim to develop a bus booking system with a more comfortable system that provides clear booking information for the user.
Our project has already adopted The Knight Bus concept from the Harry Potter movie series to simulate the booking system. Our booking allows users to book a bus by specific day, time, floor, bed, origin station, and destination station.
